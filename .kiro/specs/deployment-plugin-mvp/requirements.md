# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Backstage deployment plugin MVP that provides a unified view of deployments across GitHub Actions workflows. The plugin will integrate with Backstage components through annotations, allowing teams to visualize and manage deployments directly from their developer portal. The MVP focuses on environment configuration, deployment status visualization, and basic deployment history using Backstage's existing GitHub OAuth integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see which Backstage components are registered for deployment management, so that I can understand which applications are available for deployment operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Backstage component has the deployment plugin annotation THEN the system SHALL display it in the registered applications list
2. WHEN viewing the registered applications list THEN the system SHALL show the component name, description, and GitHub repository information
3. WHEN a component lacks the required annotation THEN the system SHALL NOT include it in the deployment management interface
4. WHEN clicking on a registered application THEN the system SHALL navigate to the application's deployment dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to configure deployment environments for registered applications, so that I can define where and how applications should be deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a registered application THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to add new environments
2. WHEN creating an environment THEN the system SHALL require environment name, GitHub workflow path, and target job name
3. WHEN creating an environment THEN the system SHALL optionally accept GitHub environment name for protection rules
4. WHEN saving environment configuration THEN the system SHALL store it in memory for the current session
5. WHEN environment configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
6. WHEN viewing existing environments THEN the system SHALL allow editing and deletion of configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see deployment environment cards showing current status, so that I can quickly understand what's deployed where.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an application's deployment dashboard THEN the system SHALL display cards for each configured environment
2. WHEN displaying an environment card THEN the system SHALL show environment name, current deployed version, and deployment status
3. WHEN a deployment is actively running THEN the system SHALL indicate the in-progress status on the environment card
4. WHEN no deployment has occurred THEN the system SHALL show "No deployments" status
5. WHEN deployment status cannot be retrieved THEN the system SHALL show an error state with retry option
6. WHEN environment cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL use visual indicators (colors, icons) to represent different deployment states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view detailed deployment information when clicking on an environment card, so that I can see deployment history and logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on an environment card THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed environment view
2. WHEN viewing environment details THEN the system SHALL display a list of recent deployments with timestamps and versions
3. WHEN viewing environment details THEN the system SHALL show deployment status for each deployment attempt
4. WHEN viewing environment details THEN the system SHALL provide links to GitHub workflow runs for detailed logs
5. WHEN deployment history is empty THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
6. WHEN deployment data fails to load THEN the system SHALL show error state with retry functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the plugin to integrate seamlessly with Backstage's existing GitHub authentication, so that I can access deployment information without additional login steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing deployment features THEN the system SHALL use the user's existing Backstage GitHub OAuth token
2. WHEN GitHub API calls are made THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the user's permissions
3. WHEN the user lacks required GitHub permissions THEN the system SHALL display appropriate permission error messages
4. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with user-friendly messages
5. WHEN GitHub authentication expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication through Backstage's standard flow

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the plugin UI to follow Backstage design patterns, so that it feels native to the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying plugin components THEN the system SHALL use Backstage UI components from https://ui.backstage.io/
2. WHEN Backstage UI components are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to legacy Backstage components
3. WHEN displaying data tables THEN the system SHALL use Backstage's Table component with consistent styling
4. WHEN showing cards THEN the system SHALL use Backstage's Card component with proper spacing and typography
5. WHEN displaying forms THEN the system SHALL use Backstage's form components with validation styling
6. WHEN showing loading states THEN the system SHALL use Backstage's Progress components
