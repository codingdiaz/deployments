# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Backstage deployment plugin by implementing ownership-based filtering and grouping on the deployments page. Instead of showing all registered applications by default, users will only see applications they "own" according to Backstage catalog ownership metadata. Applications will be grouped by their owning Backstage group or user, with an option to toggle visibility of all registered applications. This improves the user experience by reducing noise and focusing on relevant applications while maintaining access to the full application list when needed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see only the deployment applications I own by default, so that I can focus on applications relevant to my work without being overwhelmed by the full organization's application list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the deployments page THEN the system SHALL display only applications where the current user is listed as an owner in the Backstage catalog
2. WHEN accessing the deployments page THEN the system SHALL display only applications where the current user's team/group is listed as an owner in the Backstage catalog
3. WHEN no owned applications exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message with guidance
4. WHEN owned applications are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality (navigation, status display, etc.)
5. WHEN the user lacks ownership information in their profile THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message explaining the ownership requirement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see my owned applications grouped by the owning team or user, so that I can easily understand the organizational structure and find applications managed by specific teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying owned applications THEN the system SHALL group applications by their primary owner (user or team)
2. WHEN an application has multiple owners THEN the system SHALL use the first owner listed for grouping purposes
3. WHEN displaying grouped applications THEN the system SHALL show the owner name as a section header
4. WHEN displaying grouped applications THEN the system SHALL show the count of applications per owner group
5. WHEN an owner group has no applications THEN the system SHALL NOT display an empty group section
6. WHEN applications have no owner specified THEN the system SHALL group them under an "Unassigned" section

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer or team lead, I want to toggle between viewing only my owned applications and viewing all registered applications, so that I can see the broader organizational deployment landscape when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the deployments page THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle control to switch between "My Applications" and "All Applications" views
2. WHEN toggling to "All Applications" view THEN the system SHALL display all registered applications with deployment annotations
3. WHEN toggling back to "My Applications" view THEN the system SHALL return to the ownership-filtered view
4. WHEN in "All Applications" view THEN the system SHALL maintain the same grouping by owner functionality
5. WHEN the toggle state changes THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's preference for the current session
6. WHEN in "All Applications" view THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish applications the user owns from those they don't own

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand when I might not have access to deployment data for an application I can see, so that I can anticipate potential permission issues before clicking into detailed views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying applications in "All Applications" view THEN the system SHALL indicate which applications the user may not have GitHub access to
2. WHEN a user clicks on an application they don't own THEN the system SHALL handle GitHub permission errors gracefully
3. WHEN GitHub permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages explaining the access limitation
4. WHEN GitHub permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to request access if applicable
5. WHEN displaying applications the user doesn't own THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator (icon, badge, or styling) to indicate potential access limitations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ownership filtering to work seamlessly with Backstage's existing catalog ownership model, so that the feature integrates naturally with our existing organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining ownership THEN the system SHALL use the `spec.owner` field from Backstage catalog entities
2. WHEN resolving user ownership THEN the system SHALL check if the current user matches the owner directly
3. WHEN resolving group ownership THEN the system SHALL check if the current user is a member of the owning group
4. WHEN ownership information is missing THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without breaking the application list
5. WHEN catalog API calls fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to showing all applications with appropriate error messaging
6. WHEN user identity cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL fall back to showing all applications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ownership-based filtering to maintain good performance even with large numbers of applications, so that the deployments page loads quickly regardless of organization size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the deployments page THEN the system SHALL fetch ownership data efficiently without blocking the UI
2. WHEN filtering applications by ownership THEN the system SHALL perform filtering operations without noticeable delay
3. WHEN grouping applications THEN the system SHALL render groups progressively to maintain responsive UI
4. WHEN toggling between views THEN the system SHALL switch views without re-fetching data unnecessarily
5. WHEN catalog data is large THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies for ownership information
6. WHEN ownership resolution fails for some applications THEN the system SHALL continue displaying other applications without blocking the entire list
